### About Me

👨‍🎓 Welcome to my GitHub page! I am Keith Alexander Jr., a computer engineer who is passionate about technology and engineering advancement. I also enjoy working with AI and drones.

💾 I like contributing to Open Source projects and am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. I have graduated with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Engineering. I've been working on personal software development projects and my personal website as well to keep track of my new discoveries and other fun stuff!

👘 Outside the world of tech, I love pushing myself to see my fullest potential. I currently train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Boxing & Powerlifting. Aside from the injuries, I am having much fun testing my limits. I am thankful for my Professors, coaches and teammates who help me everyday to become better 🤟
